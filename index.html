  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>I am currently enrolled as a PhD student at the <a href="https://cdt.horizon.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training</a>
    (University of Nottingham) where my research focuses on assessing guidelines
    and standards for age-appropriate design on the web. You can find my Horizon
    bio <a href="">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Through the Horizon program, I am partnered with <a href="https://5rightsfoundation.com/" target="_blank">5Rights</a>,
    a charity created by Baroness Beeban Kidron with the mission to articulate
    the rights of children in the digital environment. I am due to start an
    internship with 5Rights during the summer of 2020, where I will learn about how
    their organisation operates, and how policy work is achieved in the real world.
    Following my time with them I plan on conducting some practice-informed (and
    eventually, <em>practice-informing</em>), research on age-appropriate
    design and how it can be implemented in practice.
  </p>
  <p>I have a background in politics and philosophy (joint honours UG, and a
    postgraduate research degree in philosophy). My academic focuses prior to
    starting my PhD were in the areas of personal identity and in the political
    theory of the public realm (particularly Hannah Arendt). Following my masters
    I worked in the digital advertising industry where I gained an appreciation
    for the complex ethical challenges created by the web and how this can be a
    threat to our society's development. My experiences in marketing met with
    my background in politics, leading me to where I am today.
