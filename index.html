    <div class="card bg-light mx-auto w-75 pt-4">
      <img src="img/me.jpeg" class="card-img-top img-thumbnail mt-4 w-50 mx-auto" alt="Ephraim Luwemba">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">I am currently enrolled as a PhD student in the University of Nottingham
          at the <a href="https://cdt.horizon.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training</a>
          where my research focuses on assessing guidelines and standards for
          age-appropriate design on the web. You can find my Horizon bio <a href="">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Through the Horizon program, I am partnered with the <a href="https://5rightsfoundation.com/" target="_blank">5Rights Foundation</a>,
          a charity created by Baroness Beeban Kidron with the mission to articulate
          the rights of children in the digital environment. In early 2021 I completed my internship 
          with them. 
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">As a researcher, I was privileged to have the opportunity to work with 
          a team with such a wealth of experience in my field. As well as helping to conduct research 
          within the organisation, I had the opportunity to get involved in drafting literature, 
          engage with a conference, and to do some standards work with the IEEE. I learnt a lot about how 5Rights operates, 
          and how policy work is achieved in the real world. I continue to work alongside 5Rights 
          toward achieving the IEEE P2089 <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/2089.html" target="_blank">'Standard for Age Appropriate Digital Services Framework'</a>, 
          which is based on their 5Rights principles. Following my time with them I plan on conducting 
          some practice-informed (and eventually, <em>practice-informing</em>), research on age-appropriate
          design and how it can be implemented in practice.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">I have a background in politics and philosophy (joint honours UG, and a
          postgraduate research degree in philosophy). My academic focuses prior to
          starting my PhD were in the areas of personal identity and in the political
          theory of the public realm (particularly Hannah Arendt). Following my masters
          I worked in the digital advertising industry where I gained an appreciation
          for the complex ethical challenges created by the web and how this can be a
          threat to our society's development. My experiences in marketing has met with
          my background in politics, leading me to where I am today.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Outside of the academy, my main interests are music and walking or cycling to cool places. I play the bass
          in a gospel band and have aspirations to become a weekend warrior in the UK's underground jazz scene! My favourite
          hikes and cycle routes are in the Peak District (where the profile picture was taken).</p>
