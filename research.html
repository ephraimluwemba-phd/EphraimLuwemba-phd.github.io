        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Testing for Transparency is a workshop that will be conducted by researchers at the University of Nottingham in partnership with the children’s rights charity, <a href="https://5rightsfoundation.com" target="_blank">5Rights</a>.
          The workshop is designed to bring young people into the conversation that is happening in the government and other organisations about how the internet affects their lives. Specifically, Testing for Transparency focuses on a range of policy guidelines and standards that are emerging around the concept of age-appropriate design: how online services that are used by young people can be created, taking into account the various developmental needs of all age groups approaching adulthood.
          The workshop will explore designs for age-appropriate privacy policies and engage the participants in a discussion about how to make them a readable, more effective media for communicating information to young users.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>As part of the government’s new Data Protection Act in 2018, provisions were made for the development of standards ensuring safeguards for children when they are online. One requirement of this was that the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the independent authority responsible for overseeing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), would create an <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/consultations/2614762/age-appropriate-design-code-for-public-consultation.pdf" target="_blank">Age Appropriate Design Code</a> (‘the Code’) to help guide this process. The Code has recently been submitted to the government to be reviewed and passed into law. Testing for Transparency is an early study to assess the effectiveness of the aspects of the Code which recommend how organisations on the internet ought to present policy information to children. The Code provides notes of guidance for this, for example using images and sectioning text appropriately.
        </p>
        <h3>Workshop Outline</h3>
        <p>The workshop comprises of (i) a <em>short introductory talk</em>, (ii) a session for <em>reading sample privacy policies</em>, (iii) filling a <em>questionnaire</em> and (iv) an <em>audio-recorded discussion</em>.
        </p>
        <p>The young people who participate in Testing for Transparency will be given an introductory talk explaining what privacy policies are and how they relate to personal data. They will then be asked to read through different presentations of an existing privacy policy (based upon a popular social media site). These presentations will utilise some of the recommendations provided in the Code.
        </p>
        <p>The workshop focuses on how young people interpret privacy policies when they read them and what challenges they face understanding and maintaining interest in their contents. Therefore, after reading the policy, they will be asked to complete a survey about their experience and participate in a recorded follow-up discussion about what improvements they would make to the way the policies have been presented to them.
        </p>
        <h3>The Team</h3>
        <p>Testing for Transparency is the first of several studies planned by Ephraim Luwemba, a student at the University of Nottingham’s Horizon Centre for Doctoral training, where he is completing his PhD. His work is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), in partnership with the 5Rights Foundation. It focuses on co-creating standards for age-appropriate design on the web.
        </p>
        <p>Ephraim is supervised by <a href="https://dowthwaite.wordpress.com/work/" target="_blank">Dr Liz Dowthwaite</a>, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham’s Digital Economy Institute. Amongst other things, Liz has worked extensively with groups of all ages as a member of the teams delivering the EPSRC-funded research projects, <a href="https://unbias.wp.horizon.ac.uk/" target="_blank">“UnBias: Emancipating Users Against Algorithmic Biases for a Trusted Digital Economy”</a>,
          and <a href="https://reentrust.org/" target="_blank">“ReEnTrust: Rebuilding and Enhancing Trust in Algorithms”</a>. Both projects aim to engage public audiences, educating them about the
          use of algorithms in our society, and inviting wider participation in the development of solutions to the problems created by algorithms.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://5rightsfoundation.com" target="_blank">5Rights</a> are a foundation created with a single goal in mind: to make systemic changes to the digital world to ensure it caters for children and young people, by design and default.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://5rightsfoundation.com" target="_blank">5Rights</a> have been at the forefront of the battle to make children and young people’s voices heard in the Digital world for a long time. They have worked with the ICO and governments as far afield as Rwanda to help to create policies that place children and young people’s safety at the top of the agenda on the web. They have also conducted co-creation workshops with children and provide digital literacy campaigns in schools.
